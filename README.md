Notable Projects

    [Algorithm Visualizer]
        Description: An algorithm visualizer is a tool designed to visually demonstrate the inner workings of algorithms. By graphically representing the steps and data transformations involved, these tools help users understand complex processes such as sorting, searching, and pathfinding. Algorithm visualizers are particularly valuable in educational settings, as they make abstract concepts more concrete, aid in grasping algorithm logic, and enhance learning through interactive exploration. They also assist developers in debugging and optimizing algorithms by providing a clear view of how data is manipulated and processed.A brief overview of the project, including its purpose and technologies used.
        Role:Lead Developer, Team Member.
        Outcome: In conclusion, algorithm visualizers are powerful tools that significantly enhance the understanding and learning of algorithms

    [Malware detection using machine learning]
        Description: Malware detection using machine learning involves leveraging algorithms to identify malicious software by analyzing patterns in data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known malware signatures, machine learning models can detect new and evolving threats by learning from data features such as file characteristics, behaviors, and network traffic. This approach improves accuracy and adaptability in identifying malware.
        Role: Lead Developer, team member
        Outcome: Malware detection using machine learning leverages algorithms to identify harmful software by analyzing data patterns and behaviors. Unlike traditional signature-based methods, machine learning can detect new and unknown malware by training models on features from both malicious and benign files. This enhances the detection's accuracy and adaptabilities.
